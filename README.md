# python_for_statisticians
This is a very quick and dirty introduction to Python to get researchers up and running with Python.

# Installing Python
Python can be installed from the following linK: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Ensure that you select "Add to PATH environment variable" or "Add python.exe to PATH" in the installer to ensure you can use Python from anywhere on your machine.
Once you have run through the executable, verify it has been installed by opening Powershell and running the command:
`python --version`
If all is installed correctly you should see the current version of Python displayed. If you get an error, uhh try installing it again or follow some actual instructions.

# Running Python Programs
Once Python is installed download this repository by clicking the giant green "<> CODE" button at the top and click download zip, and place it somewhere you can remember, for example in downloads.
Open Powershell and navigate to the repository. This can be done by using the `cd <path>` command.  Simply put the full and absolute path to the download location of the repository where you see `<path>` in the previous command. If you placed it in downloads the command will look something like `cd cd C:\Users\User\Downloads`. You can move folder by folder by replacing `<folder>` in `cd <folder>` with the folder you want to go into or you can use `cd ..` to go up a folder.

You can see the contents of the current directory by using the `ls` command.

Once you have navigated to the repository in Powershell, you can run the command `python ex1_printing.py` to run the very first file in this introductory course.


# Editing Python Programs
You can use whatever text editor you prefer to edit the .py files, though I would recommend Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Once you have installed VS Code, navigate to the repository in file explorer, right click inside the folder, and select "Open in VS Code" and the folder should open in VS Code. Where you should be able to see all the Python files in the course on the left hand side. You can click on a file to open it in the editor.

You can also go to the top left corner and click "Terminal" then "New Terminal" to open Powershell inside VS Code, so you can edit and run your programs from one window.

# Ready to go!

Once all this has been done you are free to move to the main course! Check out ex1_printing.py for the most basic Python program possible. Then move to each subsequent file as you get a very quick overview of the basic functionality of Python.
